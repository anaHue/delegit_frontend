# Deleg'it frontend

Deleg'it is a voting application intended to facilitate student representation
and communication with student representatives. The idea is to give value to
anonymous opinions by general concensus, meaning that more agreed-upon opinions
are more important.

The aim of this application is to provide an overview for student
representatives of the most wide-spread opinions (like dispropotionate time
consuimg classes) or pressing matters (like schedule conflicts).

The delegit frontend display the list of the feedbacks and a form to add a feedback.
